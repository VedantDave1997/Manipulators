According to Boyer's A History of Mathematics, the identity first appeared in Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum of 1748. Euler started from the infinite series for ex, sinx, and cosx, from which the identity quickly follows. Thus from:

ex=1+x+x22!+x33!+…
sinx=x-x33!+x55!-…
cosx=1-x22!+x44!-…
substituting ix into the series for ex and rearranging terms quickly leads to the result.

Boyer also notes that Roger Cotes had derived this identity, given by him in a Philosophical Transactions article of 1714 in the equivalent form ln(cos?+isin?)=i?.
